* Requirements

- python 2.3 (it may run with earlier versions, but this is untested)
- postgresql 9.5
- plpgsql
- a database (I haven't done any namespace stuff, but if you play around with
  table names you could probably run it on a common DB.)
- crontab
- 1GB drivespace for a full round. Usable with less if you remove old tick
  information, but this will cause some breakage (for example with old scans and
  commands making use of the data included in the user feed dump)

* Install instructions

0) Install pgsql, python, etc.
a) CREATE DATABASE yourdbnamehere WITH ENCODING = 'LATIN1';
b) find every reference to the old user and dbname in the config (muninrc) and
   correct them
c) Add the plpgsql language to your database. This usually requires superuser
   access. It can either be done from the commandline with:

   createlang plpgsql yourdbnamehere

   Or in SQL when connected to the correct database with:

   CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql

d) Fix user_table.sql to insert the correct superuser pnick (it's currently
   commented out and set to jester).
e) \i user_table.sql
f) optional: insert stats (see below)
g) make sure the mods in the mod dir are the only ones you're interested in
   using.
h) copy muninrc-example to muninrc and update the values for your alliance
i) you should be set (though I've probably forgotten a bunch of stuff).

* Instructions for inserting stats

These instructions can also be found in howto_makestats.txt.

a) python utils/putships.py (or: python utils/putships.py http://url.to/stats)
optional) Set up the drupal instance to use the right db
